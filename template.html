    <p>My name is Brynner Chavez Gomez I am a student at LVTI (Lynn Vocational Technical Institution) learning all about coding as well as languages that comes along with it. I was born in Lynn and I am a junior at age 16 and while growing up I grew the interest about the internet and would like to know more about how it works and how it became to be.
